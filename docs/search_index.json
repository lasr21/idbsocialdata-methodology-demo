Adopting open-source practices can increase transparency, collaboration, and efficiency, aligning with the broader digital transformation goals. However, to harness these benefits effectively, governments must have a structured approach to managing their open-source activities. This is where an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) comes into play. This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for local, state, and federal governments to establish and manage their own OSPOs. By following this guide, government entities can create a sustainable framework to support open-source initiatives, ensuring they contribute to and benefit from the global open-source community. Data and Indicators for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is a digital platform that provides key data and indicators for regional research and development. It addresses fundamental issues such as poverty, health, inequality, employment, education, and migration and especially highlights the gender and diversity perspective. The purpose of this tool is to provide a unified source of harmonized, standardized, and comparable demographic, economic, and social data for the 26 countries of the LAC region. The goal is to invite diverse audiences to discover and study the situation in the region. This document outlines the methodology used to estimate and present data and indicators on the platform.
